# -Prediction-of-Diabetic-condition-using-Different-Machine-Learning-Approaches-and-Different-Datasets

This is my Final Year's Project of post-graduation; in this project I proposed a best machine learning model on the basis of accuracy by comparing 10 different Machine Learning algorithms over a Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle) & Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet dataset (UCI Repository). Among which Random Forest Model outperformed the others in both the datasets, achieving a remarkable accuracy at 81.57% & 100% respectively.

Software used:
Python 3.7, Kaggle Notebook, Window 11 operating system.

Dataset Used:
Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle Repository) & Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet dataset (UCI Repository)
